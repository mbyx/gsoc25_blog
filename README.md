# GSoC 2025, Blog Posts

Hello, this is the repository for my weekly blog posts as I participate in [GSoC 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [The Rust Foundation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a contributor to the project '[Modernising the `libc` Crate](./Proposal.pdf)'.

The posts will serve as both technical documentation of the work done and as a log of weekly progress.

I intend to publish at least one blog post on the Sunday of every week once the coding period starts on June 2nd.

So far weeks 1-7 have been documented.

<!-- TODO: Once GSoC 25 finishes, update the readme to use past tense -->

Feedback or questions regarding the posts can be directed to the corresponding [Zulip Chat](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Modernising.20the.20libc.20Crate/with/517672053).

To view the blog locally, clone and `cd` into the repo and run:
```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
