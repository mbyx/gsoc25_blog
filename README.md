# GSoC 2025, Blog Posts

Hello, this is the repository for my weekly blog posts as I participate in [GSoC 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [The Rust Foundation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a contributor to the project '[Modernising the `libc` Crate](./Proposal.pdf)'.

The posts will serve as both technical documentation of the work done and as a log of weekly progress.

I intend to publish at least one blog post on the Sunday of every week once the coding period starts on June 2nd.

Feedback or questions regarding the posts can be directed to the corresponding [Zulip Chat](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Modernising.20the.20libc.20Crate/with/517672053).
