A blog about my progress as I participate in [GSoC 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) for [The Rust Foundation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a contributor to the project '[Modernising the `libc` Crate](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/r3LkZkOy)'.

To summarize, my project is about porting the testing infrastructure of one of the most used crates to modern Rust, as it has been causing strange errors when exposed to new syntax. The end goal is to fix smaller issues on the way to release a new major version of the `libc` crate.

Each blog post covers work done over a specific week, with the final blog post being the mandatory work product submission for GSoC that details everything done over the 12 weeks.

As for the initial proposal, you can find that [here](./Proposal.pdf)!
