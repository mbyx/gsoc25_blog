Unfortunately, I was too busy last week to make a post. However the work done last week and this week were on the same topic. Ports!

Last week I started and finished porting `ctest-test` to use `ctest-next`. It's still in review and I expect a ton of changes but it does work perfectly, passing all test cases. In the process I also added tests for aliases, structs, and unions.

This week I began porting `libc-test`, which marks the start of integrating the new testing infrastructure into the actual codebase. I started with porting linux tests (not realising they were 1300 lines out of 5600 lines), and apart from a couple of issues was reasonably able to run the tests, passing 27865 tests in the process (automated testing truly is amazing).

I did however face an inscrutable problem. For some reason my linux header files are missing some structs and constants. Likely because I am using WSL. I was unable to figure out why and had to skip tests for those items. I hope to run it in CI to see if it's just a problem for me or not. If it is just a me problem, I'm confident that porting the rest of the 4000 lines should be quite possible.

Other than continuing the ports, the code has to be cleaned after reviews as I go, the last two tests for foreign statics and functions have to be added, and the issues blocking libc 1.0 have to be fixed.

Code wise there shouldn't be an issue but time wise we might be cutting it close.
