This week was quite fun! It was mainly spent in trying to generate, compile, and run the tests. Generation was quite easy due to [askama](https://docs.rs/askama/latest/askama/), however compiling and running is a whole other matter. While tier 1 targets in CI are tested without cross compiling, the same cannot be said about tier 2 targets, and as such the correct linker and runner needed to be present for it to work. Thankfully the current CI system already had my back in that regard, and so I was able to successfully compile and run the tests on a number of platforms, although there still are some bugs, either in the CI or in my code (guess which).

Next step is to iron out those chinks, clean the code, and get the ctest-test crate running on the new infrastructure. I tinkered with this and could do it to an extent, but it was quite buggy and cursed.

Once that is done the base of the infrastructure is done, then the frontend api has to be improved, bugs fixed, and more test generation templates are to be written.
