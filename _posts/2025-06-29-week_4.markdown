There were quite a lot of chinks in the code in fact!

Ultimately, given that we were trying very hard to fight an uphill battle against the build system, it was decided that it was best
to not try to compile the generated binary and link it ourselves, instead letting the `build.rs` file deal with that problem. This
does mean that our integration tests are limited to just non cross compiled targets now, but so long as it allows cargo and `cc`
to just work, it's a good compromise. Besides, `ctest-test` still has to be ported over, and that should provide all the testing
we need.

The whole week was spent improving the code, as I worked in another unpublished commit to figure out how to port `ctest-test` and
to add some more methods to the generation frontend. More or less, the hard part of this project has begun, with things becoming
more complex and interconnected. Once the PR is merged, two smaller PRs will be made that deal with test generation of items other
than constants, and the frontend respectively. That should finish up the 5th week, and hopefully by the end of the 6th, we shall
have finished porting over `ctest-test`, and begun integrating `ctest-next` into `libc-test`. Although that is still quite a ways
away.
